										<h2>Details</h2>
									</header>
									<p>1. The "Memory Manager" application I created was specifically tailored for Windows 8/8.1 with a primary focus on enhancing computer performance through memory optimization and cache cleaning.</p>
									<p>2. To achieve this goal, I designed a user interface using Java Swing, opting for a non-traditional approach by not relying on a database. Instead, the application was purpose-built to clean the D drive of Windows, concentrating on tasks such as identifying and deleting cache files, obsolete files untouched for six months, and duplicate files residing in the drive.</p>
									<p>3. The development process involved extensive research to pinpoint specific commands capable of locating temporary, obsolete, and duplicate files within the system. For example, executing the command "%temp%" in the Run dialog provided access to temporary files. I seamlessly integrated these commands into the application, creating a series of delete operations based on predefined criteria. This meticulous approach effectively removed unnecessary files from the D drive, thereby optimizing the overall performance of the system.</p>
									<p>4. Additionally, the Memory Manager app featured an innovative text-to-speech functionality facilitated by freetts jar files, which were added to the libraries folder of the application. Leveraging packages such as java.io and com.sun.speech.freetts, I successfully integrated this feature into the application. With this addition, the app could audibly read aloud the text displayed on the screen, enhancing accessibility for users who preferred or required spoken information. This thoughtful integration ensured a more convenient and inclusive user experience.</p>
									<p>5. I used Git to maintain the code. The collaborative nature of software development often involves version control systems like Git. </p>
									<p>6. In summary, the "Memory Manager" application I developed was meticulously crafted to streamline computer functionality. Its unique features, including cache cleaning and a text-to-speech interface, were specifically designed to improve system efficiency and accessibility for users of Windows 8/8.1, showcasing a comprehensive solution for enhancing computer performance.</p>
