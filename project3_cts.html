										<h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
									</header>
									<p>1. I played a pivotal role in the migration of multiple Java-based applications from Java 6 to Java 8. This undertaking involved extensive collaboration with clients from diverse regions, spanning Europe (Ireland, Italy, Poland, Ukraine, and the UK), the Middle East (UAE), and Africa (Dubai). My responsibilities encompassed the installation of Java 8 and corresponding Apache Tomcat on project servers or WebSphere servers, identifying necessary code modifications for Java 8 compatibility, making required changes, and pushing the updated code to the project's Git repository. </p>
									<p>2. I also oversaw the deployment of the code onto these servers and conducted thorough smoke testing on the test, QA, and stage servers after thorough local testing of the application. This testing involved both the application's user interface through various use cases and API testing using tools like Postman. This application smoke testing was conducted prior to migrating the application server and deploying the code. This involved executing a predefined set of tasks, including interacting with the application's APIs and performing actions on the UI to assess its functionality. After migrating the application server to Java 8 and deploying the corresponding code, I conducted post-migration application smoke testing to ensure the system's integrity and functionality.</p>
									<p>3. I collaborated with cross-functional teams, server administrators, and database owners to acquire necessary access rights and successfully deployed Tomcat 8, followed by Tomcat 11, on the application servers requiring migration efforts. My tenure at Cognizant Technology Solutions involved regular client interactions, particularly for the Java migration project. I frequently communicated challenges faced during delays in releases and clarified project requirement proposals, including technology choices, to clients.</p>
									<p>4. Within this role, I also assumed a leadership position within the project team. I managed sprint activities, gathered daily progress updates from team members, and effectively communicated our advancements to clients. I worked closely with managers to ensure the smooth progression of project tasks. Additionally, I maintained regular communication with clients to gather essential business requirements, ensuring effective collaboration and project alignment.</p>
									<p>5. Working within the insurance sector, I leveraged tools such as Pandas for in-depth analysis of order data. I created visual presentations to convey insights to clients, delving into customer preferences, identifying popular insurance products, and predicting purchasing behaviors based on demographic information. </p>
