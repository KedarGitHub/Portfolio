									<h3>Elevate Karnataka 2022	- 2022</h3>
									<p>I was honored to receive the 'Elevate Karnataka 2022' award in a startup competition held in Karnataka, India, for our venture 'Falcon Dynamics.' Our startup, Falcon Dynamics, focuses on designing flaps and wings for container trucks in India, enhancing their aerodynamic efficiency. Through our innovative approach, we aimed to successfully increase the trucks' efficiency by 14%.</p>
									<h3>Star of the Sprint	- 2019</h3>
									<p>​I was honored with the "Star of the Sprint" recognition at Accenture India Private Limited in acknowledgment of my exceptional dedication and significant contributions to a project. This recognition was bestowed upon me for my pivotal role in constructing the billing module of a Node.js microservice for the website of a multinational company providing network services in Australia.</p>
									<h3>Inscribe 2014	- 2014</h3>
									<p>I had the privilege of being selected as a finalist in the technical paper presentation competition, "Inscribe 2014," hosted by Bosch India Pvt Ltd. Our presentation centered around an innovative concept aimed at learning and identifying partially obscured traffic signboards caused by factors like smog, fog, or damage. Our application targeted locomotives and utilized a high-quality camera to capture images of partially visible or broken signboards. These images were then matched against a comprehensive database of Indian traffic signboards. When a match was found, the application triggered a speech prompt providing information about the signboard, and the corresponding image was displayed on the car's screen. This technology aimed to enhance safety and awareness on the roads.</p>
									<h3>The Aerotrix Super Challenge  - 2014</h3>
									<p>I was honored with the "Best Fabrication" award in "The Aerotrix Super Challenge," organized by Aerotrix and Conscienta in 2014 at IIST Trivandrum. This competition revolved around designing a remote-controlled airplane prototype. Over the course of a two-day workshop, participants received instruction on aerodynamics and the process of building an airplane prototype. On the third day, we constructed the prototype and conducted flight tests to demonstrate its functionality.</p>
									<h3>Undergraduate Program Activites	- 2013-2016</h3>
									<p>​Engaged actively in the undergraduate university's table tennis and dance teams during my undergraduate years, showcasing my enthusiasm for sports and dance. Also, I organized an online gaming event that featured popular games such as FIFA, NFS, and Counter-Strike.</p>
									<h3>Middle and High School Activities	- 2005-2010</h3>
									<p>Achieved district and state-level recognition for outstanding performance in Math, Science, and English talent exams throughout middle and high school.</p>
