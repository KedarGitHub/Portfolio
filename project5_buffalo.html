										<h2>Introduction</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This project aims to conduct diverse analyses on the city's crime rate, with the primary goal of benefiting both residents and students at UB by identifying areas and months as either 'safe' or 'unsafe.' Additionally, the project summary will provide valuable insights to relevant departments, aiding them in implementing more stringent laws and enhancing overall security measures.</p>

									<h2>Importing packages and libraries</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In this project, essential tools were utilized for comprehensive data analysis and visualization. The Pandas library (aliased as pd) enabled efficient data manipulation, while SQLite facilitated structured database management. Smooth integration with the SQLite database was ensured through the Error module.<br/><br/>

									Additionally, the csv module, with an increased field size limit (100,000,000), was vital for processing extensive datasets effectively.<br/><br/>
									
									For data visualization, the Matplotlib library, specifically matplotlib.pyplot (aliased as plt), was employed to create diverse visualizations, such as graphs and charts. The %matplotlib inline command enhanced accessibility by displaying visualizations directly within the Jupyter Notebook or compatible environments.<br/><br/>
									
									In summary, the integration of Pandas for data manipulation, SQLite for database management, csv module for handling large datasets, and Matplotlib for data visualization significantly strengthened the project's analysis, allowing meaningful conclusions and insights to be drawn from the city's crime-rate data.</p>

									<h2>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In this project, the initial step involved importing a dataset titled "Crime_Incidents.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame named df_all. This dataset comprised 287,308 rows and 29 columns, containing various details such as case numbers, incident dates, types, descriptions, geographical information, and administrative details. Upon inspection, it was observed that several columns, primarily related to census data and unique identifiers, were unnecessary for our analysis. These columns, including 'Incident ID' and several census-related identifiers, were dropped from the DataFrame using the 'df_all.drop()' method.<br/><br/>

									After the removal of unnecessary columns, the dataset was refined to 17 columns. Following this, null values within the dataset were addressed. Rows with null values in any column were dropped using the 'df.dropna()' method, which resulted in a cleaned dataset comprising 282,316 rows.<br/><br/>
									
									Additionally, specific rows were further filtered out to enhance the dataset's quality. Rows with 'UNKNOWN' values in the 'Neighborhood', 'Police District', and 'Council District' columns were dropped to ensure the data used for analysis was accurate and reliable.<br/><br/>
									
									To summarize, the cleaning process involved importing the dataset, dropping irrelevant columns, removing rows with null values, and filtering out specific rows with 'UNKNOWN' values. These steps were executed using various Pandas methods, ensuring the dataset was well-prepared and suitable for in-depth analysis.</p>

									<h2>Inserting information into normalized.db.</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In this project, several functions were developed to create and populate a SQLite database named "normalized.db" with the cleaned and processed crime data. These functions were designed to streamline the process of database creation and data insertion. Let's break down the key components of this code:</p>
									<header class="major">
										<h4>1. Database Connection and Table Creation Functions:</h4>
									</header>
									   <strong>'create_connection(db_file, delete_db=False)':</strong> Establishes a connection to the SQLite database. If 'delete_db' is set to True, it deletes the existing database file before creating a new one.<br/><br/>
									   <strong>'create_table(conn, create_table_sql, drop_table_name=None)':</strong> Creates a table in the database based on the provided SQL schema. If 'drop_table_name' is specified, it drops the table with that name before creating a new one.<br/><br/>
									   <strong>'execute_sql_statement(sql_statement, conn)':</strong> Executes a SQL statement and returns the fetched rows.<br/><br/>

									<header class="major">
									   <h4>2. Data Insertion Functions:</h4>
								   </header>
									   <strong>'insert(sql, values, conn)':</strong> Inserts values into the specified table using the provided SQL statement and connection.<br/><br/>
									   Functions like 'create_neighborhood(df_n, db_file)', 'create_parentincidenttype(df_n, db_file)', 'create_policedistrict(df_n, db_file)', 'create_councildistrict(df_n, db_file)', and 'create_description(df_n, db_file)' create tables for neighborhood, incident type, police district, council district, and description, respectively. They then populate these tables with unique values from the corresponding columns in the dataset.<br/><br/>
									   <strong>'create_crime(df_n, db_file)':</strong> Creates a "Crime" table in the database. It references foreign keys from other tables (IncidentType, Description, Neighborhood, PoliceDistrict, and CouncilDistrict) and inserts relevant data into the table.<br/><br/>
									
									<header class="major">
										<h4>3. Lookup Dictionary Functions:</h4>
									</header>
									   <strong>'create_dictionary(tablename, db_file)':</strong> Creates a dictionary for a specified table in the database. This dictionary maps the values from the table to their corresponding IDs, allowing efficient referencing when inserting data into other tables.<br/><br/>
									
									The code first creates tables for neighborhood, incident type, police district, council district, description, and finally, the main "Crime" table. Data from the dataset is appropriately mapped to these tables, ensuring data integrity and referential integrity constraints. The resulting database provides a normalized structure for efficient querying and analysis of the crime data.<br/><br/>
									
									These functions collectively establish a robust database system, making the dataset ready for in-depth analysis and generating valuable insights for stakeholders and researchers.</p>

									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								</header>
								<p>The prevailing crime in the city is theft, closely followed by assault incidents. Notably, criminal activities reach their peak precisely at midnight, indicating a significant spike in reported crimes during the late hours. Furthermore, Friday emerges as the day with the highest crime count throughout the week, suggesting a notable surge in incidents at the end of the workweek.<br/><br/>

									Analyzing the data over the course of the year, it becomes evident that the transition from late summer to early fall witnesses the highest crime count. This seasonal pattern indicates a potential correlation with changing weather conditions or social behaviors during this period.<br/><br/>
									
									Delving into neighborhood-specific data, Broadway Fillmore and Central Terminal areas emerge as the most crime-prone neighborhoods within the city. Conversely, Seneca Babcock and First Ward are statistically identified as the safest regions in Buffalo, showcasing significantly lower crime rates.<br/><br/>
									
									Additionally, when examining law enforcement jurisdiction, Police District D stands out with the highest number of reported incidents. This observation underscores the importance of focusing on this district to implement targeted strategies aimed at crime prevention and community safety.<br/><br/>
									
									These findings provide valuable insights for local authorities and policymakers, enabling them to prioritize resources, enhance surveillance, and design tailored interventions. By understanding these patterns, law enforcement agencies can effectively allocate personnel and resources to areas with higher crime rates, fostering a safer environment for the residents of Buffalo.</p>
