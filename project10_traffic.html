										<h2>Details</h2>
									</header>
									<p>1. During the course of my undergraduate studies, I undertook the development of an educational application known as "Indian Traffic Signals." This application was meticulously crafted to serve as a static desktop platform, offering a wealth of information on the diverse aspects of traffic regulations, signals, and road signs prevalent in India. The primary objective behind this initiative was to enhance public awareness and understanding of the intricate traffic rules in the country.</p>
									<p>2. For the technical implementation, I delved into Java frameworks, specifically leveraging Java Swing to create an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface. Java Swing provided the necessary tools and components to design a visually appealing and interactive user experience. To establish a robust connection with the underlying database, I employed Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), a standard Java API for database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language and a wide array of databases.</p>
									<p>3. The core of the application's data management resided in a MySQL database named "Traffic Signals." This database served as the repository for a comprehensive collection of information related to traffic rules, signals, and road signs specific to India. By utilizing MySQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system, I ensured efficient storage, retrieval, and management of the vast array of traffic-related content.</p>
									<p>4. Git's branching and merging capabilities likely aided in managing different features and bug fixes concurrently, ensuring a streamlined and efficient development workflow.</p>
									<p>5. The development process was facilitated using Visual Studio Code, a lightweight yet powerful source code editor, which provided a seamless environment for coding, debugging, and version control. Leveraging the capabilities of Visual Studio Code, I meticulously crafted the front end of the application, focusing on creating an engaging and informative interface for users.</p>
									<p>6. Upon successful integration of the frontend with the backend database, rigorous testing and debugging processes were undertaken to ensure the application's stability and reliability. Once these stages were completed, the application was ready for deployment.</p>
									<p>7. The culmination of this effort was the successful deployment of the "Indian Traffic Signals" application on the Microsoft Store, specifically tailored for the Windows 8/8.1 platform.</p>
									<p>8. By making this application accessible to users through the Microsoft Store, I aimed to contribute significantly to public education regarding traffic regulations in India, fostering a safer and more informed environment for all road users.</p>
